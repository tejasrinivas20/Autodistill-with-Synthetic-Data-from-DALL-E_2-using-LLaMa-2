## Introduction

The "Autodistill with Synthetic Data from DALLE-2 using LLaMa 2" project is aimed at utilizing synthetic datasets generated by combining the two advanced AI models: DALL-E 2 and LLaMa 2. DALL-E 2 is an image generation model developed by OpenAI, and LLaMa 2 is a language model developed by Meta, capable of generating diverse and creative text prompts. The project's primary goal is to use these text prompts as inputs for DALL-E 2 to create synthetic datasets, which can then be used to train machine learning models, using the Autodistill.

Autodistill uses big, slower foundation models to train small, faster supervised models. Using autodistill, you can go from unlabeled images to inference on a custom model running at the edge with no human intervention in between.

By leveraging synthetic data, we can potentially improve the target model's robustness, reduce the dependency on large-scale real-world data, and enhance the overall training efficiency.

## Usage

1. Preparing the prompts

- Visit [LLaMa 2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Explore_llamav2_with_TGI) to generate creative and diverse text prompts. These prompts will act as inputs for DALL-E 2. Here I've chosen to generate traffic lights dataset.

2. Generate the images

- Go to [DALL-E 2](https://labs.openai.com/) to genreate the images from the prompts given by LLaMa 2.
- Since DALL-E 2 provides around 4 images for each prompt, try using it several times to acquire enough images.
- Download the resultant images and place them in the appropriate directories.
